1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,540
There is a very strong tradition and saying of the companions of the prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) in this regard.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,929
Abdullah ibn umar (may allah be pleased with him) تعالیٰ they say.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,910
مَن بَنَ بِبِلَادِ الْعَاجِم.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:21,320
Those who lived in the areas of non-muslims, non-muslim nations, in their cities, in their countries.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,760
وَصَنَعَ نَيْرُوزَهُمْ وَمِحْرَجَانَهُمْ.

6
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:31,589
Let their neeruz and mehrejan celebrate their eids themselves.

7
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,250
وَتَشَبَّحَ بِهِمْ حَتَّى يَمُوتُ وَهُوَ كَذَلِكَ.

8
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:42,439
And he may imitate them and in that state he may die.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,000
خُشِرَ مَاہُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,859
He will be resurrected with them on the day of judgment.

11
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:49,609
I am reading the hadith again.

12
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:52,649
They say مَن بَنَ بِبِلَادِ الْعَاجِم.

13
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,630
Those who go and settle in the land of foreigners.

14
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,479
وَسَنَعْ نیروزَهُمْ وَمِحْرَجَانَهُمْ.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,240
And their nerves and embarrassments.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,040
That is, celebrate their eids and celebrate them yourself.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,140
وَتَشَبَّحَ بِهِمْ حَتَّى يَمُوتُ وَهُوَ كَذَلِكَ.

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,359
And imitate them.

19
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,159
Even if it means death.

20
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,620
خُشِرَ مَاہُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ.

21
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,579
His fate will be with them on the day of judgment.

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,980
It turned out that whoever imitates whom in the world.

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,719
His end will be with him in the hereafter.

24
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,319
As we saw in the hadith.

25
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:36,060
مَن تَشَبَّحَ بِقَوْمٍ فَهُوَ مِنْهُمْ.

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,480
Whoever imitates the nation they are from among them.

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,900
This tradition has been narrated by imam al-bayhaqi in the book al-jaziya.

28
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,079
Hadith number 18863.

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,739
18863.

30
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:52,560
So, from this hadith, this is the statement of the companions.

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,920
But what are you talking about?

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,260
This is not a man saying this from his own opinion.

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,000
That is why this saying.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,939
That is, the ruling will be accepted.

35
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:05,010
Rather, it would have been further confirmed by this hadith.

36
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,629
Which is the original hadith of this chapter.

37
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:09,509
مَن تَشَبَّحَ بِقَوْمٍ فَهُوَ مِنْهُمْ.

38
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,949
Whoever imitates the nation they are from among them.

39
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:15,280
So it follows that.

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,860
Celebrating other nations' holidays.

41
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,719
It is not permissible in islam.

42
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,099
Celebrating other nations' holidays.

43
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,379
It is not permissible in islam.

44
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,620
Our eids are for allah. تعالیٰ did.

45
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,259
Set for us.

46
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:32,719
No one has the authority to celebrate eid.

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,759
Eid is a sacred command.

48
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,520
Which is from allah.

49
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,759
It is based on revelation.

50
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,840
A man on his own behalf.

51
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,580
Can't make it.

52
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,780
It is important to remember this.
