1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,940
Similarly, one of the etiquettes of the worldly mosque is not to talk about worldly and vulgar things in the mosque.

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,880
The prophet of allah (peace and blessings of allah be upon him) says:

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,519
سَيَكُونُ فِي آخِرِ زَمَانِ قَوْمٌ.

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,419
There will be some people like that in the end times.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,719
يَجْلِسُونَ فِي الْمَسَاجِدِ حِلَقًا حِلَقًا.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,870
They will sit in circles in the mosques.

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,609
اِمَامُهُمُ الدُّنْيَا.

8
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,309
اُن the goal will be the world.

9
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:29,050
They will sit in the mosque but…

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,309
The gossip will be from the whole world.

11
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:33,390
The goal will be the world. اُس from sitting.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,109
No afterlife, no reward.

13
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,079
فَلَا تُجَالِسُوہُم.

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,820
So don't sit with them.

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,659
فَإِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لِلَّهِ فِيهِمْ حَاجَةً.

16
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:44,240
Because allah will have no need of them.

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,789
That is, they will have no place to sit in the presence of allah.

18
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,020
Imam al-tabarani narrated this.

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,259
And this is a tradition of beauty.

20
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,780
This shows that.

21
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,579
Gossiping about the world in the mosque.

22
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,619
And make that the goal.

23
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:59,460
And to do it sitting in the mosque.

24
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,780
And talking nonsense in mosques.

25
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,520
There is no room for such things.

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,420
Let's talk a little bit here and there.

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,299
Okay, but turn mosques into dens of gossip.

28
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,159
God forbid, this is not a good thing.

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,379
And especially in this one.

30
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,060
Things are like that in the world too.

31
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,299
There are trade issues.

32
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,439
And there are things that are against the atmosphere of the mosque.

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,579
So this is not right.
